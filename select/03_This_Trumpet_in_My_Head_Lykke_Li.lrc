[00:39.35] I can't get that trumpet out of my head
[00:41.75] I can't get that trumpet out of my head
[00:44.38] I woke up and I can't get that trumpet out of my head
[01:10.88] 
[00:50.47] And you say you can't stand me when I'm quiet
[00:55.36] And so I shot you in my silence
[00:59.27] I can't get that trumpet out of my head
