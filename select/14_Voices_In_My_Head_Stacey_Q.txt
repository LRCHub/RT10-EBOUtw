I'm not alone
I'm not alone

I'm not alone
I'm not alone
(Can anyone hear these voices in my head?)
(Can anyone hear these voices in my head?)

I'm not alone when you're not here
But I don't fear when they're near
I hear what they're saying without using words
I know what they want without being heard
They know the truth you try to hide
You're ready to ride when the morning shines
Call it intuition, but I can't let go
It's a state of grace until I say so

Can anyone hear these voices in my head?
I can't explain these things that must be said
I know what they want without being heard
Can anyone hear these voices in my head?
I can't explain these things that must be said

Voices in my head
(Can anyone hear these voices in my head?)
Voices in my head
(Can anyone hear these voices in my head?)
(Can anyone hear these voices in my head?)

Stop
Stop
Stop
Stop

(I know what they want)

Stop, fast forward, or rewind
Travel to another place in time
Stop, fast forward, or rewind
Travel to another place in time
Stop, fast forward, or rewind
Travel to another place in time
Stop, fast forward, or rewind
I'm not alone

Can anyone hear these voices in my head?
I can't explain these things that must be said
Can anyone hear these voices in my head?
I can't explain these things that must be said

Voices in my head
(Can anyone hear these voices in my head?)
Voices in my head

I hear what they're saying without using words

Call it intuition, but I can't let go
It's a state of grace until I say so
